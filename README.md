# Star-Wars---Factions
Expands the rimverse with many iconic and memorable weapons, apparel, and factions from Star Wars lore.


Xen's public notes:

1. Load Order:
Mods must be loaded in this order - (RELATIVE TO EACHOTHER - they dont need to be at the top of the mod list, bottom is probably preferable.)
  1st Lightsabers
  2nd Force
  3rd Factions
  
  Bad load order causes some malfunctions in force powers.



2. Powers Notes:
Powers are currently very early stage, and most need new classes or adjustments to the special abilty class.

What works?
Lightning is 100%
Rage/berzerk is 99% (it works currently, but we may change the method before final)
Storm is 25% (it fires a projectile, hurts target, but no AOE like it should)
Choke is 25% (It's currently just a rapid-fire, low damage projectile thingy, needs reworking)

Mind Trick is 50% (Similar to berzerk, needs poking to work 'properly' as we intend)

Other powers are primarily placeholders/dummies to allow us (mostly Jecrell) to build the GUI and other system features.



3. Saber notes:
There should be minimal issues with the Sabers. 

Currently crafted at Component Assembly Bench
Sabers need a crystal to function
Crystals affect saber color and attack speed/damage - also other potential benefits (deflection etc)
Basic crystals can be refined from stony at electric smelter, rarer crystals come from traders (currently)
pawns wielding a saber must be drafted to activate saber (so be careful not to let them get jumped unawares)
pawns will auto-deactivate sabers upon cancelling draft

4. Factions notes
The "factions" mod is basically a dump for my overproductivity in generating weapons and armor and other content.

Imperial and Rebel factions -
Imperial faction works like pirates, they're jerks. (currently. Maybe later add Imperial alignment options?)
Rebels work like regular spacers/other normal factions.

Most weapons and armor from this are craftable with basic "Complex clothing", "Powered armor", and "Charged Shot" researches.
